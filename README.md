# Python Libraries Contributor Gender and Geographic Distribution

## AI-related Programming Language Top Library Contributors

Understanding the distribution of contributors and the gender gap within the AI development community is crucial for advancing gender equality and promoting inclusivity in this rapidly evolving field. Python is the most widely used programming language for AI-related projects. According to Stack Overflow, approximately 45.32% of developers use Python for AI development. 

To streamline AI project development and avoid writing code from scratch, developers leverage libraries with diverse functionalities. Coursera identifies the best Python libraries for AI and machine learning as:
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PyTorch

These open-source libraries are critical for streamlining AI project development, making it essential to understand who is contributing to them. Given the significant role these contributors play in developing and maintaining these libraries, we are interested in their geographic distribution and gender information.

Understanding the gender and geographic location of contributors is crucial for several reasons:
- Highlights the diversity within the AI development community
- Identifies potential gaps in representation
- Promotes inclusivity, particularly for women in AI

By examining this information, we can better understand the current landscape and advocate for more equitable participation across different regions and genders.

## Methodology

Using the GitHub API, we retrieved data on contributors. We then used Python libraries to infer the geographic information and gender of contributors, supplementing and verifying uncertain inferences with information from LinkedIn profiles, Google Scholar, and personal websites. Our analysis involved plotting figures to study the data, revealing significant gender and geographic disparities.

## Results

Out of 367 contributors:
- 346 are male
- 21 are female

We created an interactive map displaying the locations and genders of the contributors. This map shows that most contributors reside in the United States, European countries, India, China, and Japan. Female contributors are primarily from the United States, Germany, and France. A screenshot of the map is provided in the appendix.

## Analysis

Our analysis highlights a stark disparity between male and female contributors in AI-related libraries and language, with only 21 out of 367 contributors being female. Some countries show more female representation than others. This significant gender gap underscores the need for greater representation of women in AI. 

Understanding and promoting diversity within this community is a critical step toward ensuring that AI technologies are developed by a workforce that reflects the diversity of its users, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.

## Conclusion

While Python remains the dominant language for AI development, and contributions come mainly from global northern countries and China, there is a notable disparity in gender representation among contributors. By understanding and promoting diversity within this community, we can ensure that AI technologies are developed by a diverse workforce, benefiting society as a whole.
